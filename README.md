MovefilesToaNewFolder.py

    Use Case: If you have multiple folders in a directory and each folder has multiple files, and if you want to copy all of those files to a single folder, then this python code would help. 
      Example: When I downloaded the photos from my Iphone to my desktop, it created a folder for each month and there are set of photos in each folder. I just want to copy all of the photos to a single folder.
